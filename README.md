# SpriteSparkEngine

**SpriteSparkEngine** is a 2D game engine developed in C++ with a focus on modern, efficient game development practices. This project was created as part of a Bachelor's thesis at the SRH Hochschule Heidelberg, showcasing a comprehensive implementation of a data-driven architecture and leveraging the Vulkan API for high-performance graphics rendering.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of SpriteSparkEngine is to provide a flexible and powerful foundation for 2D game development, enabling developers to create high-quality games with efficient resource management and scalable architecture. The engine's data-driven approach separates data from logic, making the engine highly adaptable to different game genres and facilitating easier maintenance and expansion.

## Key Features

- **Data-Driven Architecture**: Facilitates the separation of game logic from data, making the engine highly adaptable and maintainable.
- **Vulkan API Integration**: Utilizes Vulkan for cutting-edge graphics rendering, ensuring optimal performance and cross-platform compatibility.
- **Cross-Platform Support** (Work in Progress): While designed to run on various operating systems, cross-platform support is still under development.

## External Libraries

The following external libraries are utilized in the SpriteSparkEngine to provide essential functionality:

- **GLFW**: 
  - Used for handling input and managing the window context. 
  - [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org) is a lightweight library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts and handling user input.

- **GLM**: 
  - Employed for SIMD-accelerated vector operations and other mathematical functions related to rendering.
  - [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) is a header-only C++ mathematics library for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specifications.

- **OpenAL**: 
  - Used for implementing all sound and music functionalities within the engine.
  - [OpenAL](https://www.openal.org) is a cross-platform audio API designed for efficient rendering of multichannel three-dimensional positional audio.

- **Vulkan**: 
  - Utilized for all rendering processes within the engine.
  - [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) is a modern cross-platform graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern GPUs.

- **dr_flac.h**, **dr_mp3.h**, **dr_wav.h**: 
  - These headers are used to import sound files in FLAC, MP3, and WAV formats, respectively.
  - They are part of the [dr_libs](https://github.com/mackron/dr_libs/tree/master) single-file public domain libraries for audio decoding.

- **json.h**: 
  - This header is used to import and convert Tiled tilesets and tilemaps into the engineâ€™s format.
  - It is a minimalistic [JSON parser](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) written in C, used for lightweight and easy-to-integrate JSON parsing.

- **stb_image.h**: 
  - Used to import images in various formats for use within the engine.
  - [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) is a popular, public domain, single-file library for image loading.

# Project Structure and Usage

## Directory Structure

The `SpriteSparkGame` directory contains the following important subdirectories and files:

- **Levels/**:
  - Contains JSON files that describe the levels of the game, including tilesets and tilemaps.
  - Example: `vp_ts_metroidlevel.json`, `vp_lv_metroidlevel.json`

- **Shaders/**:
  - Stores shader files used for rendering in the engine.
  - Example: Vertex and fragment shader files specific to Vulkan rendering.

- **Sound/**:
  - Contains audio files that are used within the game.
  - Example: `Theme of Samus Aran, Space Warrior - Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.mp3`

- **Source/**:
  - Contains the source code for the game logic.
  - Example: `App.cpp` implements the main game application.

- **Textures/**:
  - Stores texture files used for rendering sprites and tilemaps in the game.
  - Example: `vp_ts_metroidlevel.png`, `vp_sptsht_player.png`

## Example Usage of the Engine (`App.cpp`)

The `App.cpp` file demonstrates how to use the SpriteSparkEngine to create a basic game. Below are the key components:

### Creating the Application
Finally, the TestApp class creates an instance of the application and adds the TestLayer to it:

```cpp
class TestApp : public SpriteSpark::Application {
public:
    TestApp() {
        PushLayer(new TestLayer());
    }
};

SpriteSpark::Application* SpriteSpark::CreateApplication() {
    return new TestApp();
}
```

### Creating a Layer

A `Layer` in SpriteSparkEngine represents a collection of related game entities and systems. In `App.cpp`, `TestLayer` is defined as follows:

```cpp
class TestLayer : public Layer {

public:
    TestLayer() : Layer("Test") {}

    void OnInit(Camera& camera) override {
        // Initialization code here
    }

    void OnUpdate(float deltaTime, Camera& camera) override {
        // Update code here
    }

    void OnRender(FrameInfo& frameInfo) override {
        // Render code here
    }
};
```

### Initializing the Layer
The OnInit function is used to initialize various components of the game, such as loading textures, sounds, and setting up entities:

```cpp
void OnInit(Camera& camera) override {
    sound.setFilepath("Sound/Theme of Samus Aran, Space Warrior - Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.mp3");
    GlobalLoader::LoadSprites(entityManager, 3, tilemap, "Levels/vp_ts_metroidlevel.json", "Levels/vp_lv_metroidlevel.json");

    // Example of creating and setting up an entity
    Entity player = entityManager.createEntity();
    entityManager.addComponent(player, Player{});
    entityManager.addComponent(player, Transform{ {240.0f, 3194.0f}, {1.0f, 1.0f}, 0.0f });
    entityManager.addComponent(player, Sprite{ playerSprite, {0.0f, 0.0f, 16.0f, 32.0f} });

    sound.play(true);
}
```

### Updating and Rendering
The OnUpdate function handles game logic such as input processing and physics simulation:

```cpp
void OnUpdate(float deltaTime, Camera& camera) override {
    if (Input::IsKeyPressed(Key::Up)) {
        volume += 0.01f;
        sound.setVolume(volume);
    }

    movementSystem.update(entityManager, camera, deltaTime);
    physicsSystem.update(entityManager, deltaTime);
    collisionSystem.update(entityManager, deltaTime);
}
```

The OnRender function is responsible for rendering the entities:

```cpp
void OnRender(FrameInfo& frameInfo) override {
    spriteSystem.render(frameInfo, entityManager);
}
```
